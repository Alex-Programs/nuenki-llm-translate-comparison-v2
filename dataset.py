        "I built that, and made it open source. It turns out that you can! While its coherence is slightly lower than its peers (more on that in a moment), it is the most idiomatic model while also being far more consistent, with a much lower standard deviation across all three metrics.

        "The people who get what they want in these situations are the ones who are prepared to behave sufficiently unreasonably, and with sufficient stubbornness. This is a second order consequence of 'unaccountability' that Davies misses. For the customer, or the object of the system, it incentivises unpleasant behaviour - as unpleasant as possible - because it's often the only way to trigger the exception / escalation / special case, and get what you want.",  # comment on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43877301 - with some minor changes
        'They then run stepwise regression to determine variance contributions, seemingly ignoring their earlier results, and this leads to almost no contribution from numeracy. Why? Because they have ~10% shared variance and stepwise regression is greedy - will just take whatever you give it first. I can\'t mention this part enough. If you got a second, very similar language test, and added it to the model, you would _also_ find it has almost no unique variance added. Every thing they measure is incredibly noisy and they do not once attempt to deal with this. Human based reviewers, time-to-completion, etc. p-value for "language learning is more significant than numeracy" on the values they give (Steiger test) gives 0.772. Utterly insignificant.',  # https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43870969
        "This article reminds me of another I read first here, 'Reality Has A Surprising Amount of Detail' by John Salvatier.

        "In the end I realised it would take far too long, but I wanted to experiment with getting a bunch of AIs to yell at each other until they came to a consensus. I suspect you would have trouble balancing their RLHFd agreeableness (conceding too early) and the impression of prompting. If you told them to keep arguing the case and not be instantly agreeable, they would never stop. Maybe you could have them follow a template to make things a bit better.",  # something I wrote in the nuenki discord
        "We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.",  # end of churchill's "We Shall Fight"/"Finest Hour" speech. Certainly in the training data! But quite complex prose, and it's good to have some training data prose too.
        "Either way, since the very first network censors have existed, there have been people trying to circumvent them. The techniques of censorship and circumvention have rapidly advanced in a continually evolving arms race. In 2006 the most advanced censorship apparatus at the time, the Great Firewall of China (GFW), could be bypassed by simply bilaterally ignoring the injected TCP connection resets [4]. By 2011 the GFW was actively probing suspected servers [5] and by 2021 it was analyzing the entropy of traffic to catch fully-encrypted protocols [6]. And permitted protocols aren’t safe either: The GFW has analysed the exterior dataflow of SSH connections using machine learning (ML) to detect and block SSH tunnels since at least 2016 [7]",  # A level computer science project!

        "It's less about cost, more about latency. It already uses Claude and Llama for translating text that isn't yet visible (precisely because of cost), but they're just too slow. They'd probably be better if I hosted them myself, but I can't justify the massive fixed cost for that at the moment. I am curious though, would you be alright with higher latency if it meant the sentences included context?",  # nuenki discord
        """It raises concerns about how scientific it is to run a dynamic algorithm, rather than simply calculating a fixed batch of comparisons then fitting a model to them. Nevertheless, it may well produce much better results, and I can't think of any concrete statistical flaws with it provided we're careful about ensuring a minimum amount of linkage.""",  # nuenki blog post
