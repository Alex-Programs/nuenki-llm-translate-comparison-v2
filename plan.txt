- Better execution format. We use an inheritance based system to define how we translate things in a structured, ordered way.
- Better distinction of service providers.
- More robust latency handling by running it on a server with a dedicated line.
- Caching, obviously. Heaps of it.
- Put everything in one program this time, rather than chaining.
- Bradley-Terry, obviously
- Seperate text datasets as well as separate languages
- Also store data separately for different evaluators
- The end goal is that you can pick:
language
text type
evaluator(s)

and it produces the ELO just for that. Ofc we don't want to do that client side, so pregen that stuff.

oh and also correctly handle when some models (e.g. deepl) can't translate a lang. I guess just detect that it's not possible, then skip over, and have it missing from the dataset for those areas.

still limit to English->Other lang.

*maybe* include formality.
